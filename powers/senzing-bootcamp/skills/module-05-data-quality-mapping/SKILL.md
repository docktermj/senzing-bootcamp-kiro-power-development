# Module 5: Data Quality, Mapping, and Transformation

> **MCP grounding (mandatory — applies to this entire skill).** Every Senzing fact you present —
> SDK method and attribute names, config options, error codes, and entity-resolution specifics —
> MUST come from the Senzing MCP tools, never from training data, memory, or speculation.
> **Pre-response checklist:** if a reply contains any Senzing specific, you MUST have called an MCP
> tool this turn to obtain it; if not, stop and call it first. This has the same precedence as a ⛔
> gate. The full rule and tool routing are the "MCP-first invariant" in
> `../bootcamp-onboarding/ground-rules.md`.

Follow `../bootcamp-onboarding/ground-rules.md` throughout (👉 one-question-at-a-time,
MCP-first, file placement, checkpointing). Execute every numbered step one at a time, in
order. Never skip, combine, or abbreviate a step containing a 👉 question: this has the same
absolute precedence as a ⛔ mandatory gate, and no internal reasoning can override it.

**First:** Read `config/bootcamp_progress.json`, then (per ground-rules) show the module start
banner, journey map, before/after framing, a brief numbered overview of this module's steps, an estimated time-to-complete (INV-096), and the recommended model/effort nudge (INV-063), before any module work.
**When it carries a `quality_iteration`, none of this runs:** go straight to Phase 2 →
[Receiving a `quality_iteration`](phase2-data-mapping.md#receiving-a-quality-iteration). A return
runs only the steps it names, so the steps it leaves out are not skipped steps.
**When it records Module 5 at the retired step 26, none of this runs either:** Module 5 is already
complete, and [Resuming](#resuming) says what to present.

**Before/After:** You have raw data files but don't know if Senzing can use them directly.
After this module, each source is scored for quality, categorized, and transformed into
Senzing JSON: validated and ready to load.

**Prerequisites:** ✅ Module 4 complete (data sources collected, files in `data/raw/`).

**Success indicator:** ✅ Each data source evaluated (sources evaluated, mapped) +
transformation programs tested + output validated with quality >70%.

## Reference notes

- **Quality scoring methodology:** When a bootcamper asks how a score was calculated, what
  each dimension measures, or what a threshold means, explain it directly using the dimension
  definitions in Phase 1 (field completeness, format consistency, duplicate rate). The
  dimension definitions in Phase 1 are the authority; there is no standalone methodology guide.
  Use `search_docs` for any Senzing-specific quality guidance.
  ⛔ Because the completeness helper is authored fresh each run until that guide is ported, use
  the **presence test defined in Phase 1 step 6** rather than writing one from scratch. Two traps
  it exists to close: never use a truthiness test (`if value:`) — `false` and `0` are present
  values — and never use key presence as coverage, which reports 100% for a field that is an
  empty array in every record. Both are INV-128, which is the statement of record for what counts
  as present and what counts as absent. When the guide is ported, implement presence exactly as Phase 1
  defines it and carry the caution into the ported methodology.
- **Multi-language data:** If a source contains non-Latin characters (Chinese, Arabic,
  Cyrillic, etc.), retrieve current guidance on UTF-8 encoding, non-Latin character support,
  cross-script name matching, and multi-language data quality practices. Never answer from
  training data. ⛔ **Query with the filter and the sections below — a bare
  `search_docs(query="globalization")` does not reach this material** (INV-212). All four
  topics live in **one document**, the "Senzing Globalization Guide". This call reaches it and
  is verified (server 1.37.19, docs index 2026-10-02 18:46 UTC, 2026-10-04) — swap the query for
  the terms in the row you need, and keep the filter either way:

  ```text
  search_docs(query='UTF-8 encoding non-Latin character support multi-language data quality', category='globalization')
  ```

  | What you need | Section to ask for |
  |---|---|
  | UTF-8 encoding, and what "supported language" means | "What languages does Senzing support?" |
  | Cross-script name matching | "Advanced personal name comparisons > Supported cultural groups" |
  | Which scripts are actually covered | "Advanced personal name comparisons > Additional Cultural Support" — a transliteration table (Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, East Slavic, Turkish, Yoruban, Generic). It also states Japanese **Kanji is treated as Chinese Hanzi** — a limitation worth telling the Bootcamper. |
  | Cross-script addresses, and the data-quality practice | "Enhanced address comparisons" and "Address matching examples > CJK+English cross-script matching" — native-to-native beats native-to-Romanized, and for non-CJK cross-script, Romanize via an address-hygiene product and supply **both** the native and Romanized forms. |

  ⚠️ **The bare call is not the route, even though its Guide hits are usable.** Unfiltered,
  `search_docs(query='globalization')` does return Senzing Globalization Guide sections with
  real prose, and a Guide section it returns can be used like any other. But the bare term
  also admits unrelated `Global*` substring matches: the Rust SDK's `static GLOBAL_ENVIRONMENT`,
  `postgresql-performance-v4`'s "Global — more workers" (autovacuum tuning) and an MDM-Lite FAQ
  on "globally unique ID". Drop those, since they are not about globalization. The bare call
  also did not return the "What languages does Senzing support?" section, which holds the
  UTF-8 answer. So keep `category='globalization'` as the route. (Verified live via
  `search_docs`, server 1.37.13, docs indexed 2026-09-24 18:45 UTC, 2026-09-26.)
  <!-- MCP-NEGATIVE: search_docs(query='globalization') — returns Globalization Guide sections but not the "What languages does Senzing support?" answer, and also admits unrelated Global* substring matches beside them — owner: search_docs(query='UTF-8 encoding non-Latin character support multi-language data quality', category='globalization') returns it, as the "What languages does Senzing support?" section (routing negative — the category boost ranks the answer first; the bare query also admits unrelated Global* matches) — server 1.37.13, 2026-09-26 -->

  ⛔ **The words "best practices" are their own trap (INV-212): they return confidently wrong
  content, which is worse than returning nothing.** Unfiltered,
  `query='multi-language data quality best practices'` returned its **top six of ten** results
  as repo `docs/best-practices.md` template files (`senzingsdk-tools`, `senzingapi-runtime`,
  `senzingapi-tools`, `senzingsdk-runtime`, `homebrew-senzingsdk`, `scoop-senzingsdk`) about
  Markdown lint and Dockerfiles — **no globalization content at all**, two of them title-only
  stubs. With `category='globalization'` the on-topic rows come back first, but those same files
  remain in the set carrying the **highest** `relevance_score` (~89 against ~9–13), so never rank
  by score here. Seeing any of this
  is evidence you mis-queried, never that the documentation is thin. (The sections above and
  this trap verified live via `search_docs`, server 1.37.19, docs indexed 2026-10-02 18:46 UTC,
  2026-10-04.)
  <!-- MCP-NEGATIVE: search_docs(query='multi-language data quality best practices') — returns no globalization content at all — the hits are repo template docs/best-practices.md files about Markdown lint and Dockerfiles, none carrying non-Latin or cross-script guidance — owner: search_docs(query='data quality practices multi-language non-Latin', category='globalization') returns it, as "Address matching examples > CJK+English cross-script matching" (routing negative — the category filter is what recovers it) — server 1.36.0, 2026-09-02 -->

## Error handling

When the bootcamper hits an error during this module:

1. **SENZ error code** (message contains `SENZ` + digits, e.g. `SENZ2027`): call
   `explain_error_code(error_code="<code>", version="current")` and present the explanation and
   recommended fix. If it returns nothing, continue to step 2.
2. Present the matching pitfall/fix for this module. There is no bundled `common-pitfalls`
   reference, so use `search_docs` to look up the symptom.

Two `mapping_workflow` failure modes have their own handling in
`phase2-data-mapping.md`, both under "Availability-aware mapping validation" — do not improvise
either one:

- a **validation script is unavailable** (HTTP 404) → degrade that check to optional/best-effort
  and proceed;
- **step-3 validation rejects the payload with no actionable reason** (a truncated error naming no
  field) → capture the raw rejection to the source's checkpoint, stop after two attempts, and offer
  the pinned three-option question. Writing the mapper against the Entity Specification is a
  sanctioned outcome there, with all three quality gates still running.

## Phases

- **Phase 1: Quality Assessment** (steps 1–7): `phase1-quality-assessment.md`
  (includes a Senzing-readiness check and fast-path-to-loading offer for eligible sources).
- **Phase 2: Data Mapping** (steps 8–20): `phase2-data-mapping.md`.
- **Phase 3: Test Load and Validate (Optional)** (steps 21–25): `phase3-test-load.md`. It tests
  one source and always returns to Phase 2 (step 19, or step 17 to iterate). Module 5 is completed
  only at Phase 2 step 20.

## Resuming

Read `current_step` from `config/bootcamp_progress.json` and resume at the right phase. During
mapping, also read any `config/mapping_state_[datasource].json` checkpoint to resume a
per-source `mapping_workflow` run where it left off.

**A progress file that recorded Module 5 at step 26.** Phase 3 used to end on a step 26, which ran
Module Completion and then wrote its checkpoint, so a Module 5 `current_step` of 26 written under
that flow means Module 5 is already complete. Treat it so: present only Phase 2 step 20's pinned
transition 👉 question, naming the next selected module from `selected_modules`, and checkpoint as
step 20 does. Do not run Module Completion again: no second Module 5 recap section, no second
end-of-module summary, and no Phase 3 question (INV-284).
