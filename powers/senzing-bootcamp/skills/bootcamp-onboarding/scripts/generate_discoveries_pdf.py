"""Render the data-discoveries Markdown into a PDF deliverable.

Reads ``docs/bootcamp_data_discoveries.md`` and writes
``docs/bootcamp_data_discoveries.pdf``.

This is the **sibling** of ``generate_recap_pdf.py``, not a replacement for it.
That script is deliberately recap-shaped: it keeps body text only when it sits
under one of four recognized ``### `` sub-headings, so aiming it at a
discoveries document produced a valid-but-nearly-empty PDF. Rather than
generalize a parser whose strictness is load-bearing for the recap, this script
renders a general Markdown subset and reuses the recap generator's low-level PDF
plumbing (page writer, wrapping, escaping) so there is exactly one hand-rolled
PDF writer in the plugin.

Supported Markdown: an H1 title, ``**Key:** value`` preamble meta lines, H2/H3
headings, ``-``/``*`` bullets at two indent levels, ``**Label:** text`` lines,
fenced code blocks (rendered verbatim), Markdown tables (rendered as a real
grid of rows and columns), and paragraphs. Everything content-bearing is rendered — that is the
point of the audit below.

A valid PDF is ALWAYS produced when the input is sound, via the same tiered
strategy as the recap generator:

1. ``fpdf2`` when importable — a designed cover plus flowing sections.
2. A stdlib-only writer when it is absent. The reporting bootcamper had none of
   ``pandoc``, ``wkhtmltopdf``, ``weasyprint``, ``reportlab`` or ``fpdf2``
   installed, so the fallback is the common case, not an edge case.

Per INV-110 the input is audited **before** rendering and two outcomes are
distinguished:

* **Incomplete but recognizable** (some required sections missing) — warn on
  stderr, render, exit 0. A partial findings document still has value.
* **Not a discoveries document, or catastrophic content loss** (no headings at
  all, none of the required sections present, or content retention below
  ``MIN_CONTENT_RETENTION``) — write the reason to stderr, print no
  ``PDF generated:`` line, write no PDF, and exit non-zero.

Success signal: on success it prints a line beginning ``PDF generated:`` and
exits 0. Any other outcome means no PDF was written.

Usage:
    python3 generate_discoveries_pdf.py [--input docs/bootcamp_data_discoveries.md]
                                        [--output docs/bootcamp_data_discoveries.pdf]
                                        [--check]

``--check`` audits without rendering and exits non-zero if the document would
not render usefully.

Copying this script elsewhere: it imports the shared PDF plumbing from
``generate_recap_pdf.py`` (expected next to this script) and the palette from
``brand_tokens.py``. Copy **all three** together; a lone copy either fails loudly
on the first import or falls back to the inlined palette, and says so on stderr
(INV-111).
