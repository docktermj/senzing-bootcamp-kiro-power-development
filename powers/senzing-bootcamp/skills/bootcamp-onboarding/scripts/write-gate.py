"""PreToolUse gate for Write/Edit: to block writes outside the Bootcamper's project,
and block obvious secrets -- DURING a bootcamp only.

Two independent checks, governed by two different invariants:

* **Location (INV-200)** -- every file the bootcamp writes lives inside the Bootcamper's
  project. Blocks any resolved target outside it, including one reached by a ``..``
  escape; allows project-relative and in-project absolute paths, including a project
  that legitimately lives beneath a temp directory (resolve, then compare). System temp
  and ``~/Downloads`` are not a separate rule -- they are the cases that get a more
  specific message than the general boundary one.
* **Secrets (INV-109)** -- PEM private keys, AWS access-key IDs and Senzing ``AQAAAD``
  license blobs are blocked whatever the path. Runs independently of the location logic
  and fails closed.

Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell is required.
Native JSON parsing replaces the previous grep/sed field extraction.
