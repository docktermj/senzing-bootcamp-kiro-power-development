"""The one definition of what counts as a secret in a file the Power handles (INV-109).

`write-gate.py` blocks a *write* whose content matches these; `package_bootcamp.py` excludes a
*member* whose content matches them. Two consumers, one rule -- so a pattern added for one is
available to the other, and neither can quietly protect less than the other.

⚠️ **`write-gate.py` keeps its own inline copy on purpose, and a test pins the two equal.** It is a
`PreToolUse` security control: an ImportError there does not degrade to "no secret scan", it
degrades to a hook that cannot run at all, on every write in the bootcamp. The Power already has
this exact shape for `brand_tokens.py`, whose palette is inlined into two generators with
`tests/test_brand_sync.py` asserting the copies stay equal; `tests/test_secret_patterns_are_shared.py`
does the same job here. Import this module from anything that is *not* the write gate.

The three patterns, and why each is written the way it is:

- **PEM private keys** -- the armor line, with the optional algorithm word, so `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`
  and `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY` both match.
- **AWS access-key IDs** -- `AKIA` plus exactly 16 uppercase-alphanumeric characters.
- **Senzing license payloads** -- the documented `AQAAAD` prefix plus at least 16 base64
  characters. ⛔ The long tail is load-bearing: without it the pattern fires on prose that merely
  mentions `AQAAAD` and on `.lic` file *paths*, which would make the gate block documentation about
  licenses and the packager exclude the guidance describing them.

Stdlib only.
