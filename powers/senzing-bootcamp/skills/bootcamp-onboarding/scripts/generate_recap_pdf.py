"""Render the bootcamp recap Markdown into a professional recap PDF.

Reads ``docs/bootcamp_recap.md`` and writes ``docs/bootcamp_recap.pdf``.

A valid PDF is ALWAYS produced, via a tiered strategy:

1. Rich renderer using ``fpdf2`` when it is importable: a designed cover page
   plus one section per completed module, each carrying its four labeled
   sub-sections (Information Shared, Questions & Responses, Actions Taken,
   End-of-Module Summary; legacy "Journal" is accepted as an alias).
2. Stdlib-only fallback writer when ``fpdf2`` is absent: a plainer but valid,
   paginated PDF rendered from the same parsed content, with no third-party
   dependency.

The script is dependency-light: its only optional sibling import is ``brand_tokens``
(the shared Senzing brand palette that ships next to it in ``scripts/``), and it
falls back to an inlined copy of those values if that module is unavailable — so it
still works when bundled inside the Claude plugin and invoked from a bootcamp
working directory, and always produces a valid PDF.

Success signal (matches the graduation skill's contract): on success it prints
a line beginning ``PDF generated:`` and exits 0. Any other outcome means no PDF
was written.

Required input structure. This is NOT a general-purpose Markdown renderer: it
reads the bootcamp recap structure specifically —

    # <Recap title>
    **Bootcamper:** <name>          <- preamble "**Key:** value" meta lines

    ## <Module name> — <date>       <- one H2 section per completed module
    ### Information Shared          <- content lives under these H3 headings
    ### Questions & Responses
    ### Actions Taken
    ### End-of-Module Summary       <- carries three labeled blocks (INV-103):
    **What you accomplished:** …       What you accomplished, Files produced,
    **Files produced:** …              Why it matters. A block the recap does not
    **Why it matters:** …              record renders as "(not recorded)" rather
                                       than vanishing, and `--check` reports it.

Body text is kept only when it sits under an H3 sub-heading of a module section
(see ``parse_recap``), so a document whose H2 sections have no recognized
sub-headings renders as headings with empty bodies. To keep that from shipping
as a plausible-looking but empty deliverable, the input is audited **before**
rendering and two outcomes are distinguished:

* **Incomplete but recognizable** (e.g. one module missing a sub-section) —
  warn on stderr, render, exit 0. Graduation is non-blocking, so an imperfect
  recap still produces its PDF.
* **Not a recap, or catastrophic content loss** (no module sections, no section
  carrying any recognized sub-section, or content retention below
  ``MIN_CONTENT_RETENTION``) — write the reason to stderr, print no
  ``PDF generated:`` line, write no PDF, and exit non-zero. Here an empty
  deliverable would be worse than none.

Every successful render also reports a content-retention figure, so silent
truncation is visible without extracting the PDF's text.

Usage:
    python3 generate_recap_pdf.py [--input docs/bootcamp_recap.md]
                                  [--output docs/bootcamp_recap.pdf]
                                  [--check]

``--check`` verifies, without rendering, that every module section in the
recap carries the required labeled sub-sections and exits non-zero if any are
missing.

# a `multi_cell` at line height 5.5 and no trailing gap, so the space between two
# separate items equals the space between a wrapped item's own lines, and multi-line
# items run together. A small gap between items (never after the last) fixes it.

#

#       - **R:** the answer        <- gap; the next question starts a new pair

# themselves the defect: a list added or renamed later was silently unspaced, and
# "Files produced" was excluded on the stated belief that it was "a short reference list
# of one-line paths". `bootcamp-onboarding/module-completion.md` requires every entry to
# be a path **plus** a "— what it is" gloss, so in real recaps that list runs 5-12 items
# at 110-188 characters — the very case the gap exists for, and the one list where it was
# switched off. The exclusion looked right because it was reasoned from the list's
# *title* rather than from what the template makes its items contain.

    Two tables, one authoritative and one not, is the defect. There is now one:

    is what drifted the first time.

    A character that still arrives unencodable is **dropped and recorded**, so
