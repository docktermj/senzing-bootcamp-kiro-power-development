"""UserPromptSubmit hook: "to keep the in-progress recap checkpoint durable".

Guarantees `docs/progress/recap_checkpoint.md` exists while a bootcamp is running,
and reminds the guide to keep it current **before** anything is at risk.

Why this runs per turn rather than at session start. A bootcamp becomes active
partway through a session — `config/bootcamp_progress.json` is written during
onboarding — by which time the SessionStart hook has already run and found no
bootcamp. Only a per-turn hook creates the file within one turn of the bootcamp
starting. The cost is one `os.path.exists` on turns where it already exists.

Why the reminder cannot live only in the PreCompact hook. That hook cannot fire until
a compaction is already under way, which is after the window in which the checkpoint
had to have been written for there to be anything to preserve. A full bootcamp ran ten
modules without the file existing, in a session that had crossed a compaction
boundary. So the reminder is emitted here, once per session, while it can still act.

Non-blocking and silent apart from that one reminder: the checkpoint's own status goes
to stderr (see recap_checkpoint.py), never to stdout, which for this event carries a
structured JSON payload.

Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell is required on
any platform (INV-052).
