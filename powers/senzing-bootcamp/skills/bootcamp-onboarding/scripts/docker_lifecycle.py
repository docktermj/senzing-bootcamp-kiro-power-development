"""Shared helper for the bootcamp container lifecycle hooks (INV-101).

Any container the bootcamp starts is recorded in ``config/bootcamp_progress.json``
under a ``docker_containers`` list (each entry carrying at least a ``name``, and a
``runtime`` naming the CLI that started it). This module stops those recorded
containers and surfaces them on resume, so the guide can restart or regenerate them.

Kiro has no session-end trigger, so nothing stops a recorded container automatically:
stopping them at close-out is the guide's job, and `senzing-bootcamp-tier1-session-lifecycle.md`
is where that instruction lives. The `SessionStart` hook (`session-start.py`) does use
this module to surface recorded containers on resume.

The bootcamp does not always run on Docker. Docker Desktop cannot be installed
non-interactively (it needs administrator privileges an agent cannot supply), so on
macOS Apple Silicon a bootcamp may legitimately run under Apple's ``container`` CLI
instead. Each entry therefore records the runtime that started it, and every action
here dispatches on that runtime rather than assuming ``docker``. An entry with no
``runtime`` key is treated as ``docker``, so progress files written by earlier runs
keep working unchanged.

The list key stays ``docker_containers`` even though its entries are no longer
Docker-only: renaming it to ``containers`` would read better but would break every
in-flight bootcamp's progress file for a cosmetic gain.

All container-CLI interaction is OPTIONAL and gated on that runtime's CLI being
present: when the CLI is absent, missing, or erroring, every function
warns-and-continues and never blocks the hook. Pure Python 3 stdlib, no third-party
dependency (INV-052/INV-001/INV-002).

This is NOT a hook itself. It is imported by ``session-start.py`` (the ``SessionStart``
hook) and by ``session-end.py`` (inert in Kiro, but runnable by hand at close-out).
Those run in exec form (``python3 <hook>.py``); Python puts each script's own directory
(this ``scripts/`` directory) on ``sys.path``, so ``import docker_lifecycle`` resolves
here on Linux, macOS, and Windows alike.
