"""SessionEnd hook: to preserve your in-progress recap when the session ends.

When a bootcamp is active, fold the in-progress module recap checkpoint into
docs/bootcamp_recap.md so quitting mid-module never loses that module's narrative
(deterministic, idempotent, append-only — see recap_checkpoint.py), and stop any
container the bootcamp started so it does not linger after exit, using the runtime
CLI recorded with it (``<runtime> stop``, never remove, so it can be restarted on
resume — see docker_lifecycle.py, INV-101). Silent and non-blocking: it emits no
output, and every container step is optional and warns-and-continues when that
runtime's CLI is absent or errors.

Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell is required on
any platform (INV-052). Python is already a hard bootcamp dependency.
