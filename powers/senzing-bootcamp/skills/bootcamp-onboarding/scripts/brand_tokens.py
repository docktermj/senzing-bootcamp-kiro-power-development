"""Senzing brand tokens — the single, shipped source of truth for visual styling.

Extracted from the Senzing "Obsidian & Ember" style reference
(`resources/senzing-style-reference.pdf`, a maintainer asset that is NOT shipped
with the Power). The generators that produce bootcamper-facing visual
deliverables — the Truth-Set visualization web app / snapshot
(`senzing_viz_server.py`) and the recap PDF (`generate_recap_pdf.py`) —
consume these tokens so every artifact shares one look and feel, rather than each
hardcoding its own ad hoc palette.

Both consumers import this module from their own directory (it ships alongside
them in `scripts/`) and fall back to an inlined copy of these same values if the
import ever fails, so they never depend on the PDF at runtime and keep working
even in isolation (mirrors the vendored-D3 offline fallback).

Style-guide key rules encoded here:
- Dark backgrounds are Obsidian/Deep, never pure black.
- The accent is the ember family (ember-core on light, ember-hot as the hotter
  tone), never a flat unrelated orange/red.
- Signal green is reserved for live/resolved states — never decorative. It is NOT
  used for categorical data-source node colors.
- Light sections are warm off-white, never cold grey.
- Body text is softer than headline ink; headlines are strongest.

# thing worth seeing. Assign colors from the sources actually present, via
# `color_for_sources()`.

# stroke width is set, so "no stroke" is one state and the three stroke colors are three
# more — 4 rendered states, never 3. Counting the returned `stroke` string instead is how
# the capacity was overstated: 3 strokes x 6 fills reads as 18 combinations, the renderer

def color_for_sources(sources):
    """Map the data-source codes actually present to distinct colors.

    Truth Set names keep their preferred `SOURCE_COLORS` assignment; every other source
    takes the next `FALLBACK_COLORS` entry not already claimed by a preferred one, so two
    sources can never collide on the first cycle. `SIGNAL_GREEN` is never assigned — it is
    reserved for live/resolved states and is explicitly not a categorical color.

    Past the first cycle the encoding widens along three further channels, in order:
    stroke colour, stroke width, then a lightness perturbation of the fill itself. That
    gives `SOURCE_ENCODING_CAPACITY` distinct **rendered** appearances — the key the
    browser actually draws being ``(fill, stroke when a width is set, width)``. Up to 24
    sources the rendered result is identical to the pre-widening behavior, which was
    correct at that scale; the widening only adds states past the point it stopped being.

    Beyond capacity a warning is issued rather than colliding silently: an acknowledged
    limit is defensible, an invisible one is not.

    Ordering is deterministic (sorted), so the same model yields the same legend on every
    rebuild — otherwise a re-rendered snapshot or a re-captured screenshot disagrees with
    the recap prose describing it.

    Returns ``{source_code: {"fill": "#RRGGBB", "stroke": "#RRGGBB",
    "stroke_width": float|None, "cycle": int}}``. `stroke_width` is None when no stroke is
    drawn, and it is what a renderer must key on — `cycle` says which wrap a source landed
    in, not whether anything is visible.
