"""Stop hook: to nudge for a single closing 👉 question (a safety net). It fires
ONLY when a bootcamp is active AND the model actually forgot the question, and it can
NEVER loop.

Gates, checked in order. The hook stays silent (exit 0, no output) unless every
gate passes:
  1. stop_hook_active is true  -> return success immediately. This is the loop
     breaker: a Stop hook that blocks re-runs on the continuation it caused, so
     without this guard the nudge re-fired every turn until Kiro hit its
     block cap.
  2. No config/bootcamp_progress.json -> not a bootcamp; never touch unrelated
     sessions.
  3. The bootcamper opted out (env var or preferences key) -> stay silent. Gives a
     documented way to quiet the nudge without removing the hook; removing it
     outright is the `bootcamp-enforcement-setup` skill's `remove` path.
  3b. The bootcamp is complete (``bootcamp_complete: true`` in preferences, set by
     graduation before the terminal "END OF SENZING BOOTCAMP" banner) -> stay silent,
     so the net never nudges for a closing question after the bootcamp is over.
  4. The current turn already ended with a 👉 question -> the closing question
     exists, so add nothing (honors the "ask each question only once" invariant).

Gate 4 detection is deliberately biased toward silence. A blocking Stop hook forces
the model to produce output again, so a false positive is how a bootcamper ends up
seeing the same 👉 question twice — the #1 complaint (zero tolerance). Three defenses
address it: (a) the gate inspects the turn's FINAL assistant message (handling a
string OR list ``message.content``) rather than a concatenation, so an unflushed
closing line is not mistaken for a pointer-less turn; (b) it treats a turn that is
still settling as undecided and stays silent — when the last transcript record is a
tool call (an assistant record ending in ``tool_use``) or a tool result (a ``user``
carrier inside the turn), the closing 👉 message has not been written yet, which is
the partial-flush race seen on tool-using turns; and (c) even if the hook does block,
the block reason tells the model to verify its own last message first and repeat
nothing, so a false block can never surface as a duplicate question.

Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell is required.
