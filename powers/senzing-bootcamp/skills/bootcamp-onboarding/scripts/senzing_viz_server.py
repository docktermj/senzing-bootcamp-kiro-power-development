"""Bundled Senzing entity-resolution visualization web app — the shipped reference.

Per INV-090 the Truth Set visualization server is built in the bootcamper's chosen
programming language, modeled on this reference and the ``visualization-api-reference.md``
contract; this Python script is run directly only when the chosen language is Python. It
delivers the standalone **Truth Set visualization module** (Module 3b) "wow moment" and is
reused for Module 7 result views. System Verification (Module 3) uses synthetic data and
does not visualize (INV-082/INV-087).

It builds an entity model from the records the bootcamper loaded (by looking each
one up through the Senzing SDK, so all data comes from real entity resolution),
then serves:

- ``GET /``            single-page D3 v7 visualization (all tabs + summary banner)
- ``GET /api/stats``   aggregate resolution statistics (incl. per-bucket entity lists
  under ``bucket_entities`` for the clickable histogram, and ``data_sources_total``)
- ``GET /api/graph``   entity nodes + relationship edges (the Entity Graph tab, in both
  its full-population and relationship-subgraph modes)
- ``GET /api/merges``  multi-record entities with constituent records
- ``GET /api/search``  search-by-attributes with resolution reasoning
- ``GET /api/why``     explain WHY the records in an entity resolved together
  (``why_records`` / ``why_record_in_entity``); ``?entity_id=<id>``
- ``GET /api/how``     explain HOW an entity was constructed from its records
  (``how_entity_by_entity_id``); ``?entity_id=<id>``
- ``GET /api/records?entity_id=``  the constituent records of one entity
- ``GET /api/overlap``    cross-source overlap matrix (which sources share entities)
- ``GET /api/matchkeys``  match-key frequency (which feature combos drive resolutions)
- ``GET /api/features``   feature-score distribution across a capped sample of
  multi-record entities (from ``why_records``; degrades gracefully)

These endpoints back a single consolidated, tabbed visualization app — the one artifact
Module 7 offers for results visualization (it no longer produces separate static pages).
Its tab set is exactly **six** (INV-155), in this order: Entity Graph, Merge Statistics,
Match Keys, Feature Scores, Cross-Source, Search / Probe. The row order of the tab table
in ``module-03b-truthset-visualization/visualization-api-reference.md`` is the ordering
authority (INV-147); a tab is shown only when its data exists.

Two former tabs were **removed** and their unique capabilities live on inside that six:
the standalone *Relationship Network* tab is now the Entity Graph's "Show only entities
with relationships" **mode** (same ``/api/graph`` payload), and *Record Merges* is now the
"Show all merged entities" button on Search / Probe (``/api/merges``). There is no Results
Dashboard tab either — the entity-size distribution is the Merge Statistics histogram
(``/api/stats``), not a separate view. Their ids stay reserved rather than reused; see the
``TABS`` note in ``capture_screenshots.py``.

Data source: TWO build paths, chosen by whether ``--records`` is given. Both read the
engine through the SDK; no direct SQL is ever run against the database on either.

    --records given    one ``get_entity_by_record_id`` per record, with
                       ``SZ_ENTITY_DEFAULT_FLAGS``. Correct for the TRUTH SET, whose
                       record file is the authority on what was loaded.
    --records omitted  the export stream, one pass over every resolved entity. This is
                       the path Module 7 REQUIRES for a bootcamper's own datastore: the
                       per-record build costs one round trip per record, and it can only
                       see entities that have a record in the file it was handed, so an
                       embedded-master record the mapper emitted into no input file is
                       invisible to it.

The export path passes ``SZ_ENTITY_DEFAULT_FLAGS`` rather than a hand-assembled set of
``SZ_ENTITY_INCLUDE_*`` members, which is the opposite of the usual advice and is the
one call where the usual advice has been observed to fail; the reason is stated at the
call in ``build_model`` rather than repeated here.

Usage:
    # Serve the live web app (Python reference; run directly only when the chosen language is Python — INV-090):
    python3 senzing_viz_server.py --records src/system_verification/truthset_data.jsonl

    # Also write a persistent standalone snapshot (no server needed to view):
    python3 senzing_viz_server.py --records data/senzing-ready/*.jsonl \\
        --snapshot docs/visualizations/results.html

    # Build from the export stream instead — every resolved entity, one pass. Preferred
    # for a bootcamper's own datastore (Module 7); note there is no --records argument:
    python3 senzing_viz_server.py --snapshot docs/visualizations/results.html

    # Just build the snapshot and exit (no server), used by the completion gate:
    python3 senzing_viz_server.py --records src/system_verification/truthset_data.jsonl \\
        --snapshot docs/visualizations/truthset_verification.html --no-serve

Settings resolution, in this order — the precedence is **content-aware**, not
existence-based:

1. ``--settings`` (default ``config/engine_config.json``) when the file exists AND its
   ``PIPELINE`` carries ``CONFIGPATH``, ``RESOURCEPATH`` and ``SUPPORTPATH``.
2. ``SENZING_ENGINE_CONFIGURATION_JSON`` when the file is absent, unreadable, or
   incomplete and the env var is complete. Which source won is stated on stderr whenever
   both are present.
3. Otherwise the run fails, naming the source it used and the ``PIPELINE`` keys that are
   missing — it does NOT proceed into the engine.

⛔ Step 3 exists because proceeding produced a **misleading** failure. A file containing
``{"PIPELINE": {}}`` is valid JSON and truthy, so an emptiness check passes, and the engine
then aborts with ``SENZ7426`` (transliteration). That error means ``SUPPORTPATH`` is wrong —
``explain_error_code('7426')`` says "Check SUPPORTPATH FIRST … This is a configuration
error, NOT a broken install" — so the reader is sent to fix a ``SUPPORTPATH`` that is
correct in the place they are looking, while the value actually in force came from a file
they were not told was preferred. Validating first turns a three-step misdiagnosis into one
line naming the real cause.

The Senzing native library must be importable (source the project
``src/scripts/senzing-env.sh`` first).

Exit code 0 means the entity model was built successfully (and, if requested, the
snapshot was written); non-zero means it could not be built.
