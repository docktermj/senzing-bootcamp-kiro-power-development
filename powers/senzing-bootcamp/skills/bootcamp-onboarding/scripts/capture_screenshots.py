"""Capture one screenshot per tab of a bootcamp visualization, for the recap.

Best-effort and dependency-optional (INV-052/INV-066): this helper renders a
**local** HTML file (or a localhost URL served by the bundled visualization app)
to one PNG **per tab**, so the graduation recap PDF can show what the bootcamper
actually built. It tries several headless backends in order and uses the first
that works; if none is available it exits with code 2 so the caller degrades
gracefully — keeping the HTML link and never blocking graduation (INV-048).

⛔ **One capture per tab, never per viewport.** This script used to vary the
browser window size across a single page load — ``(1280,800)``, ``(1280,1600)``,
``(1024,768)`` — and had no interaction step at all, so every image showed
whichever tab was active by default. Three files were written, the script exited
0, and nothing looked wrong; the recap shipped three near-identical Entity Graph
shots with captions describing tabs that were never captured. Tab diversity was
not achievable, so the captions could not have been right.

Two consequences are designed in here:

* Output is named ``<name>-<tab-slug>.png``. A tab-named file makes a drifting
  caption structurally hard, and lets graduation's screenshot backfill map images
  to sections and tabs deterministically instead of by guesswork.
* Each written path is printed with its human tab label, tab-separated, so the
  caller derives the caption from the capture rather than from its plan.

How a tab is selected, without adding a browser-automation dependency:

* ``--url http://localhost:PORT`` — appended as ``?tab=<id>``, which the
  visualization app honors on load (``applyDeepLink``). ``--query`` adds ``&q=``
  so Search / Probe can be captured showing real results against the live engine.
* ``--html path/to/snapshot.html`` — a temp sibling copy is written with a small
  script injected before ``</body>`` that calls the app's own ``activate(<id>)``
  (falling back to clicking ``#navbtn-<id>``), retrying until the app's async
  init settles. Temp copies are always deleted.

Because selection happens *in the page*, every backend below works per tab —
including the ones with no interaction API.

Offline guarantee (INV-091): only local files and ``localhost``/``127.0.0.1``
URLs are ever opened. A non-local ``http(s)`` host is refused — this helper
never fetches from the network.

Backends tried, in order (each optional):
  1. Playwright (``playwright`` + a browser) — ``python3 -m pip install playwright``.
  2. Selenium (``selenium`` + a headless Chrome/Firefox driver).
  3. Headless Chrome/Chromium CLI (``--headless --screenshot``).
  4. ``wkhtmltoimage`` CLI.

Usage::

    # static snapshot, all applicable tabs
    python3 capture_screenshots.py --html docs/visualizations/foo.html \
        --out-dir docs/visualizations --name foo

    # live server, specific tabs, with a real search for Search / Probe
    python3 capture_screenshots.py --url http://localhost:8080 \
        --name results_visualization --tabs graph,stats,probe --query "Acme"

On success it prints one ``<png path>\\t<tab label>`` line per capture and exits 0.
Exit codes: 0 = wrote at least one PNG; 2 = no headless capability available
(caller should skip screenshots); 1 = bad arguments.

    and only one runs per path: the snapshot path injects ``activate()`` with a
    ``#navbtn-`` click fallback (``_ACTIVATE_JS``), while a live server is driven ONLY by
    the ``?tab=`` deep link (``_tab_url``). A server that implements the tab set, the
    section ids and the nav ids but omits deep-linking therefore serves its DEFAULT tab
    for every request — and every earlier check still passes, because the ids it looks
    for are all present. The run then writes one correctly-named PNG per tab, all of the
    same tab, reports success for each, and the images reach the recap captioned as tabs
    they do not show. Measured on 2026-08-28 against a Java server built to the contract:
    six files, five distinct images, two byte-identical, exit 0.

    ⚠️ **A source-level check, deliberately, and its limit is stated rather than hidden.**

    correctly. Verifying the RENDERED result would need a backend that can evaluate script

    injected JS and serialize the DOM. This works for the `file://` pages the bootcamp
    captures; a remote URL cannot be patched, so it returns None and the caller degrades
    to a viewport capture with an honest label rather than guessing a height.

    ⛔ **`--window-size` is not the viewport, and the difference silently crops.** Under
    `--headless=new` Chrome reserves window chrome, so a requested 1440×900 window renders
    an 813px viewport while the screenshot comes out 900px tall — the extra being blank
    padding. Screenshotting at exactly `scrollHeight` therefore loses the last ~87px of a
    tall page: measured live 2026-08-14 on a 2671px page whose footer occupied 2613-2671,
    it produced a 2671px PNG with white where the footer should be. So the offset is
    measured here (requested window height minus the `innerHeight` actually rendered) and
