"""Render any bootcamp Markdown document as a PDF in the house style.

This is a thin alias for ``generate_discoveries_pdf.py``, which despite its name is a
**general** styled-Markdown renderer: its layout engine — cover page, section styling,
tables, typography — contains nothing specific to the discoveries document. Only its
default `--require-sections` list is discoveries-shaped, and that is now a parameter.

It exists for findability. Someone looking for "how do I render a document in the house
style" will not guess `generate_discoveries_pdf.py`, and for a while that meant an
otherwise generic renderer was usable for exactly one file. The script was **not** renamed
because its name is referenced from the module-07 skill, the specs and the tests, and a
rename would break every one of those addresses for a cosmetic gain.

Usage — identical to the script it wraps::

    python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_document_pdf.py" \
        --input docs/business_problem.md \
        --output docs/business_problem.pdf \
        --require-sections "the problem;why it matters;success criteria"

⛔ **Pass `--require-sections` naming that document's own H2 headings.** Omitting it
applies the *discoveries* defaults and the document will be refused. `--no-section-check`
skips the check entirely; prefer naming the sections, because the check is what catches a
document that silently lost its structure.

⚠️ The section list is not what stops this rendering unrelated Markdown — the content
retention floor is, and neither flag relaxes it (INV-110).

Success signal, exit codes, renderer tiering (fpdf2 then stdlib) and character handling are
whatever `generate_discoveries_pdf.py` does; this file adds no behavior of its own, so the
two can never drift.
