"""SessionStart hook: to resume an in-progress bootcamp by injecting resume context.

Also folds any in-progress module recap checkpoint into docs/bootcamp_recap.md on
resume, so a module that was interrupted (quit / compaction / prior session) keeps
its in-progress narrative in the recap (see recap_checkpoint.py).

Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell is required on
any platform. Python is already a hard bootcamp dependency (the graduation recap PDF always
runs under python3; the Truth Set visualization server also does when the chosen language is
Python).
