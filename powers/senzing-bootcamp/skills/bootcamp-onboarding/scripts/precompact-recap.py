"""PreCompact hook: to preserve your in-progress recap before the conversation is compacted.

Compaction summarizes the conversation, which can drop an in-progress module's recap
narrative even though the session continues. When a bootcamp is active this hook:
  1. folds the current in-progress recap checkpoint into docs/bootcamp_recap.md
     (deterministic, idempotent, append-only — see recap_checkpoint.py), and
  2. emits a short reminder so the post-compaction guide keeps
     docs/progress/recap_checkpoint.md current at each step.

Non-blocking. Cross-platform: invoked in exec form (``python3 <path>``) so no shell
is required on any platform (INV-052).
