"""Render the graduation storyboard into a narrated, captioned recap video.

Reads ``docs/video/storyboard.json`` and writes ``docs/bootcamp_recap.mp4``: H.264 video and
AAC audio in an mp4, ``yuv420p`` for broad playability, 1920x1080 at 30 fps.

The agent writes the content; this script renders it. It follows the pattern of
``generate_recap_pdf.py`` and ``capture_screenshots.py``: a deterministic, tested renderer
behind a file the agent authors, so a language model never has to produce video itself.

How it works, in three passes:

1. **Validate.** Every scene is checked against ``SCENE_TYPES``, the one table that maps a
   scene type to its data fields and to the function that draws it. A problem is reported
   with the field that caused it (``scenes[3].items[0].value: ...``) and nothing is written.
2. **Voice, then plan the timeline.** A voice-selection stage tries a local Piper neural voice
   first (``voice_with_piper``): it voices every scene or none. When it voices none, each
   scene's narration is synthesized with the platform's own speech engine instead. Either way
   the scene lasts ``max(planned duration, narration length)``.
3. **Stream.** Frames are drawn with Pillow and written as raw RGB straight into one ffmpeg
   process's stdin. Its audio inputs are the assembled narration (48 kHz stereo, each
   narration at its scene's start) and the synthesized music bed; the same ffmpeg call mixes
   them (``audio_filter_graph``) and encodes the result. No frame is ever written to disk.

⛔ **(INV-342) Narration is never truncated: a scene whose narration runs longer than its planned
duration is extended to fit, and every overrun is reported on stderr.** Without a voice the
narration's length is estimated at ``WORDS_PER_MINUTE``, so the burned-in caption gets the
time a listener would have had.

⛔ **(INV-342) Captions are always burned in, whether or not there is a voice.** The caption defaults to
the narration, so a video rendered without a speech engine still carries every word.

⛔ **(INV-342) A storyboard image must be a project-relative local file; an absolute path, a URL, or a
path that resolves outside the project is rejected as an invalid storyboard.** A
project-relative image that is missing or unreadable is not an error: that scene is drawn as a
title card instead, and stderr says so.

⛔ **(INV-342) The renderer is offline: it opens only local files and never fetches from the network.**
Fonts come from the operating system, the palette from ``brand_tokens.py`` (INV-081), the voice
from a local Piper model already on disk (never downloaded here) or the platform's built-in
speech engine.

Storyboard format
-----------------

::

    {
      "video": {"bootcamper": "Ada Lovelace", "graduation_date": "2026-09-30",
                "music": true},
      "scenes": [
        {"type": "title_card", "duration": 6,
         "narration": "It started with a business problem.",
         "module": "Business Problem", "highlight": "Three sources, one customer view"},
        {"type": "image", "duration": 8, "narration": "...",
         "image": "docs/visualizations/results_visualization-match-keys.png",
         "heading": "Match keys"},
        {"type": "counter", "duration": 8, "narration": "...",
         "title": "Records loaded", "items": [{"label": "CRM", "value": 1200}]},
        {"type": "certificate", "duration": 8, "narration": "..."},
        {"type": "tag_line", "duration": 5, "narration": "..."}
      ]
    }

``video.music`` is optional and defaults to ``true``: a light, upbeat music bed synthesized at
render time with the standard library (no audio file ships), ducked under the voice with
``sidechaincompress`` and loudness-normalized with the voice to about -16 LUFS. The voice is
leveled first (``LEVELER``), so its peaks leave ``loudnorm`` room to reach that target. ``false``
turns it off.

Every scene carries ``type``, ``duration`` (planned seconds), ``narration`` and an optional
``caption`` (defaults to the narration). The rest depends on the type; ``--schema`` prints the
table. Keys beginning with ``_`` are comments and are ignored. The scene types:

* ``title_card`` -- a module name plus its highlight, for a module with nothing on screen.
* ``image`` -- a slow pan and zoom over a screenshot.
* ``counter`` -- animated bars and numbers: record counts per source, entities resolved.
* ``mapping`` -- source fields flowing to Senzing attributes.
* ``loading`` -- records flowing into entities, with a rising counter.
* ``entity_merge`` -- records converging into resolved entities.
* ``certificate`` -- the Certificate of Completion, drawn from the same name, date and
  completed-module list the recap PDF's certificate uses (INV-100, INV-342): the recap
  (``docs/bootcamp_recap.md``) read by ``generate_recap_pdf``'s own parser, with the
  preferences name outranking it exactly as it does there. It is drawn, never rasterized from
  the PDF.
* ``tag_line`` -- the closing card. ``text`` defaults to
  ``Resolved: <bootcamper>, Senzing graduate.``

Fallbacks, each stated on stderr (INV-111)
------------------------------------------

* **Piper first.** The voice is a local Piper neural voice (``piper-tts``, run as
  ``sys.executable -m piper``, never imported) when ``piper`` is findable by this interpreter
  and the ``--voice-model`` ``.onnx`` file and its ``.onnx.json`` config both exist. The model
  defaults to ``data/temp/piper-voices/en_US-ljspeech-high.onnx`` under ``--project-root``.
  Otherwise stderr names the case (``piper`` not installed for this interpreter, the model
  missing, or its config missing) and the platform engine below is used. Numbers in Piper's
  speech text are spelled out; the captions keep the digits.
* **Piper fails on any scene:** Piper is dropped for the whole video, and every scene is
  re-voiced with the platform engine, so the video never mixes two voices. stderr says so.
* No speech engine (macOS ``say``, Windows SAPI through PowerShell ``System.Speech``, Linux
  ``espeak-ng`` or ``espeak``), ``--no-voice``, or an engine that voiced no scene: the video
  renders without a voice-over and the captions carry the narration. The music bed still plays,
  normalized to the same -16 LUFS, so the video keeps an audio stream unless ``video.music`` is
  ``false`` as well.
* ffmpeg is not on ``PATH`` (or lacks the H.264/AAC encoders, or the ``sidechaincompress`` and
  ``loudnorm`` filters the mix needs): the binary bundled with the ``imageio-ffmpeg`` package is
  used instead, and stderr names what the first one lacked.
* A missing or unreadable image: the scene becomes a title card.
* No recap to read the certificate from: the storyboard's name and date are used.
* No TrueType font: Pillow's built-in font. ``brand_tokens.py`` unavailable: the inlined palette.

Exit codes
----------

⛔ **(INV-342) The exit codes are separate, and no video is written unless the exit is 0; a video already
at the output path is left as it was.** The render goes to a hidden partial file beside the
output and replaces it only once ffmpeg has succeeded.

= ===========================================================================================
0 rendered: prints ``Video generated: <path>``, its duration, a ``Voice:`` line and a
  ``Music:`` line
1 invalid storyboard: each problem names its field; nothing is written
2 a required capability is missing (no ffmpeg, or no Pillow); nothing is written
3 the encode itself failed (ffmpeg exited non-zero); nothing is written
= ===========================================================================================

Usage::

    python3 generate_recap_video.py [--storyboard docs/video/storyboard.json]
                                    [--output docs/bootcamp_recap.mp4]
                                    [--project-root .] [--voice-model <model.onnx>]
                                    [--no-voice] [--check] [--schema]

``--check`` validates the storyboard and exits 0 or 1 without rendering; it needs neither
Pillow nor ffmpeg. ``--voice-model`` names a local Piper ``.onnx`` model whose ``.onnx.json``
config sits beside it (default: ``data/temp/piper-voices/en_US-ljspeech-high.onnx`` under
``--project-root``). Source issues: #299, #339, #341.
