"""Package a bootcamp project into one self-describing, transferable zip archive.

A bootcamper who finishes the bootcamp had no way to archive the work or hand it to anyone else.
Graduation frames the recap PDF as "a keepsake to revisit and share with their team", and INV-094's
revisit bundle was built for the resume story -- but it is written **in place**, so it only helps on
the machine that produced it. Switching machines meant re-doing SDK setup, the database, the mapping
and the load by hand; showing the work to a colleague meant attaching four or five files with no
index; archiving before a reimage had no supported path at all.

The artifacts were never the gap. Nothing gathered them, nothing said what to open first, and
nothing decided what must **not** travel.

Two profiles, because the two audiences need different contents:

- ``share``    -- for someone looking at the results. Keepsakes, visualizations, ``production/``.
                  Never a database, never source data, never a credential.
- ``transfer`` -- for the bootcamper resuming elsewhere. Everything in ``share`` plus the INV-094
                  revisit bundle (state snapshot **and** database backup), ``config/``,
                  ``docs/mapping/`` and ``src/``.

⛔ **This script writes an archive and stops.** It never uploads, emails, attaches or opens an issue
with it (INV-135) -- moving the file off the machine is the Bootcamper's action. The output lands
**inside** the project (INV-200), under ``backups/packages/``.

⛔ **Nothing is reported as existing until it has been re-opened.** ``testzip()`` runs on the
finished archive and a ``.sha256`` sidecar is written before the success line prints (INV-067's
discipline): an archive that cannot be read is worse than no archive, because the Bootcamper will
discover it on the machine that no longer has the original.

Format is **zip**, not tar: it opens natively on Windows, macOS and Linux with no extra tool
(INV-066). Stdlib only (INV-108-adjacent: no third-party dependency in a bundled script).

Usage::

    python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/bootcamp-onboarding/scripts/package_bootcamp.py" --profile share --dry-run
    python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/bootcamp-onboarding/scripts/package_bootcamp.py" --profile transfer

``--dry-run`` prints the manifest and the total uncompressed size and writes **nothing**. The
conversation layer (`skills/bootcamp-onboarding/packaging.md`) runs it first so the consent question
can quote a real size rather than an estimate.

# embedded in `src/loader.py` was correctly excluded. The scan skipped exactly the file types

# An allowlist answering "is this worth reading as text?" cannot answer "can this contain a
# secret?". Lengthening it would be the same defect with a later trigger, so it is gone: every

# unexamined. `write-gate.py` has never had such a filter -- it scans every payload -- which is
