# Module 6: Data Processing

> **MCP grounding (mandatory — applies to this entire skill).** Every Senzing fact you present —
> SDK method and attribute names, config options, error codes, and entity-resolution specifics —
> MUST come from the Senzing MCP tools, never from training data, memory, or speculation.
> **Pre-response checklist:** if a reply contains any Senzing specific, you MUST have called an MCP
> tool this turn to obtain it; if not, stop and call it first. This has the same precedence as a ⛔
> gate. The full rule and tool routing are the "MCP-first invariant" in
> `../bootcamp-onboarding/ground-rules.md`.

Follow `../bootcamp-onboarding/ground-rules.md` throughout (👉 one-question-at-a-time,
MCP-first, file placement, checkpointing). Execute every numbered step one at a time, in
order. Never skip, combine, or abbreviate a step containing a 👉 question. This has the same
absolute precedence as a mandatory gate.

**First:** Read `config/bootcamp_progress.json`, then (per ground-rules) show the module start
banner, journey map, before/after framing, a brief numbered overview of this module's steps, an estimated time-to-complete (INV-096), and the recommended model/effort nudge (INV-063), before any module work.

**Purpose:** Guide the Data Processing workflow: build a production-quality loading program,
load all data sources into Senzing, process redo records, and validate entity resolution
results (from first load through cross-source validation).

**Before/After:** You have Senzing-formatted JSON files in `data/senzing-ready/` (and possibly
test-load results from the Data Quality, Mapping, and Transformation module). After this module, all your data is loaded, redo
records are processed, and entity resolution results are validated, duplicates matched,
cross-source connections found.

**Prerequisites:** Module 5 complete (at least one transformed data source in
`data/senzing-ready/`), SDK installed and configured (Module 2), database configured (SQLite at
`database/G2C.db`, or PostgreSQL), transformation validated with the linter.

**Success indicator:** ✅ All data sources loaded into Senzing + redo records processed + no
critical errors + entity resolution results validated.

## Error handling

When the bootcamper hits an error during this module:

1. **SENZ error code** (message contains `SENZ` + digits, e.g. `SENZ2027`): call
   `explain_error_code(error_code="<code>", version="current")` and present the fix. If it
   returns nothing, continue to step 2.
2. Present the matching pitfall/fix for this module (full `common-pitfalls` reference is a
   later porting phase; for now, use `search_docs` to look up the symptom, e.g.
   `search_docs(query="loading", category="anti_patterns", version="current")`).

## Loading code and safety (applies to every load step)

- **Loading, redo, and query code come from the MCP tools, never hand-written.** Use
  `generate_scaffold` (workflows `add_records`, `redo`, `query`) and `sdk_guide` for
  version-correct SDK code. Inline examples may use outdated SDK patterns.
- **Override MCP-suggested paths.** If a generated scaffold uses `/tmp/`, `ExampleEnvironment`,
  or any path outside the working directory, override the database path to `database/G2C.db`
  and keep all output files project-relative.
- **Back up before loading.** Ensure a backup of `database/G2C.db` exists before a load so a
  failed load can be recovered (see Phase D → Recovery from Failed Load).
- **No direct SQL.** Never generate SQL against `database/G2C.db` or its internal tables. All
  entity access goes through generated SDK code. Counts, stats, and reporting come from
  `reporting_guide` — **with a topic named**: `topic='evaluation'` for this module's statistics,
  `topic='export'` for extraction. Not `topic='reports'`, whose SQL targets a data mart the bootcamp
  never builds (see Phase D's header note).

## Phases

- **Phase A, Build Loading Program** (steps 1–4a): `phaseA-build-loading.md`
- **Phase B, Load First Source** (steps 5–11): `phaseB-load-first-source.md`
- **Phase C, Multi-Source Orchestration** (conditional, 2+ sources, steps 12–20):
  `phaseC-multi-source.md`
- **Phase D, Validation** (steps 21–28): `phaseD-validation.md`

Read `current_step` from `config/bootcamp_progress.json` and resume at the right phase.
